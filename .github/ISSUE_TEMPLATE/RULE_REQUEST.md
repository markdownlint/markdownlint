## New Rule Checklist

Before suggesting a rule for inclusion please make sure your suggestion meets these criteria for rule built into markdownlint:
 - [ ] allows a user to lint for a specific syntax divergence across the multiple flavors and styles of markdown
 - [ ] does not dictate any one specific style, but enables an end user to enable, disable, or configure the specific style of enforcement desired

## Describe The Rule:
<!---  Tell us about the rule -->

## Why Should This Be Included In Markdownlint?:
<!---  Tell us why you believe this rule should be added, considering any possible side-effects, negative impact, or changes to the behavior of existing rules -->

## Can We Help You Implement This?:
<!---  The best way to move a rule into markdownlint is to create it yourself. If you're interested in helping out we'd love to give you a hand to make this possible. Let us know if there's something you need. -->
