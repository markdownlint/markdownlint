### Rules added

### Added

* You can now load your own custom rules with the `-u` option. See
  [rules.rb](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint/blob/master/lib/mdl/rules.rb)
  for an example of what a rules file looks like. Use the `-d` option if you
  don't want to load markdownlint's default ruleset.
* You can now refer to rules by human-readable/writable aliases, such as
  'ul-style' instead of 'MD004'. See RULES.md for a list of the rule aliases.
  You can pass the `-a` option to display rule aliases instead of MDxxx rule
  IDs.

### Changed

* MD003 - An additional header style, setext_with_atx, was added to require
  setext style headers for levels 1 and 2, but allow atx style headers for
  levels 3 and above (i.e. header levels that can't be expressed with setext
  style headers)
* MD013 - You now have the option to exclude code blocks and tables from the
  line length limit check.
