# Rolling a new release

Bump the version. Markdownlint uses semantic versioning. From
<http://semver.org/>:

* Major version for backwards-incompatible changes
* Minor version for functionality added in a backwards-compatible manner
* Patch version for backwards-compatible bug fixes
* Exception: Versions < 1.0 may introduce backwards-incompatible changes in a
  minor version.

To bump the version, edit `lib/mdl/version.rb` and commit to the master branch.

Update the changelog:

* Add a new header and link for the new release, replacing any 'Unreleased'
  header.

```markdown
## [v0.2.0] (2015-04-13)

This goes at the bottom:

[v0.2.0]: https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint/tree/v0.2.0
```

* Changelog entries can and should be added in an 'Unreleased' section as
  commits are made. However, the following steps can be performed before each
  release to catch anything that was missed.
* Add a 'Rules added' section, listing every new rule added for this version.
   * Use `git diff v0.1.0..v0.2.0 docs/RULES.md | grep '## MD'` to discover
     what these are.
* Search for closed issues:
   * Go to <https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint/issues>
   * Search for `closed:>1900-01-01`, changing the date to the date
     of the last release.
   * From this list of issues, make sections for:
      * Added - for new features
      * Changed - for changes in existing functionality
      * Deprecated - for once-stable features removed in upcoming releases
      * Removed - for deprecated features removed in this release
      * Fixed - for any bug fixes
      * Security - for any security issues

Next, run `rake release`. This will:

* Tag vX.Y.Z in git
* Upload the new gem to rubygems.org

Then `git push --tags upstream` to push the tag.

Build and push a docker image per the docs in tools/docker/README.md

Finally, add a new 'Unreleased' section to the changelog for the next release.
