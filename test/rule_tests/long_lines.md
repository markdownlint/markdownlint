This is a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very long line {MD013}

This line is 80 characters which was the number of columns on an IBM punch card.
Terminals adopted the same number of characters which meant this line would wrap,
but in stern mode lines can be longer so long as thereâ€™s no whitespace after the limit.{MD013}

This line however, while very long, doesn't have whitespace after the 80th columnwhichallowsforURLsandotherlongthings.

That means that you can have long URLS without causing linting issues.
For example: <http://llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch.co.uk/history.php>
