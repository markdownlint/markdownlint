# Contributing to Markdownlint

We're glad you want to contribute markdownlint! This document will help answer common questions you may have during your first contribution. Please, try to follow these guidelines when you do so.

## Issue Reporting

Not every contribution comes in the form of code. Submitting, confirming, and triaging issues is an important task for any project. We use GitHub to track all project issues. If you discover bugs, have ideas for improvements or new features, please start by [opening an issue](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint/issues) on this repository. We use issues to centralize the discussion and agree on a plan of action before spending time and effort writing code that might not get used.

### Submitting An Issue
* Check that the issue has not already been reported
* Check that the issue has not already been fixed in the latest code (a.k.a. `master`)
* Select the appropriate issue type and open an issue with a descriptive title
* Be clear, concise, and precise using grammatically correct, complete sentences in your summary of the problem
* Include the output of `mdl -V` or `mdl --version`
* Include any relevant code in the issue
